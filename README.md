This web application was built as part of a group project for our COMP 380 class at California State University Northridge. I decided to continue my learning journey and continue to work on the project, making a copy of it on my GitHub. The first version of our project can be found <a href="https://github.com/southwatertribe/thebodegateam"> here. </a> 


## Description
The Bodega Web Application is designed to provide services for both customers and CFOs (Cottage Food Operators). CFOs will have the ability to create profiles to promote their businesses, allowing them to connect with customers who are interested in supporting their local community. The goal of Bodega is to create a platform for CFOs to showcase their businesses and provide a gateway for promotion, as small, home-operated businesses may not always receive the same level of visibility as larger, processed corporations. Bodega aims to bridge this gap and help CFOs connect with potential customers.

## Built with

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

## Through the development of this project, I learned about:

* Database design and SQL querying.

* OOP design principles in JavaScript, specifically in the creation of classes for managing database services.

* Implementing basic routing using Express.js and connecting the frontend with the backend and the database.

* Hosting and connecting the database using AWS RDS.

## My Contribution
* In my role on the project team, I made significant contributions to the model component and played a key role in the design and implementation of the application's CRUD functionality.
* Working on the Bodega Web Application was a valuable learning experience for me. I gained practical skills in database design, OOP principles, and web development, and I am proud of the important role I played in the creation of this tool for connecting CFOs with customers and promoting small, home-operated businesses.
