This web application was built as part of a group project for our COMP 380 class at California State University Northridge. I decided to continue my learning journey and continue to work on the project, making a copy of it on my GitHub. The first version of our project can be found [here](https://github.com/southwatertribe/thebodegateam).

## Description
The Bodega Web Application will provide services for both the customer and CFO (Cottage Food Operators). The CFO will be able to create a profile for promoting their business. Our purpose for Bodega is to bridge the gap between growing CFOs and customers who want to help out their local community. We want to give a gateway of promotion for the CFOs to show off their business, as some of the home-operated businesses can sometimes be shadowed by larger-processed corporations.
